          Modern sneaker culture had its roots in the air; that is, the original
          Air Jordan that released in 1985. Nike, and subsequently the Jordan
          Brand, has honored this iconic silhouette numerous times since with
          releases of the Retro 1. The Chicago Bulls used their third overall
          draft pick on Jordan, a 1982 NCAA champion who would go on to win
          Olympic gold later in the summer of 1984. Jordan signed a five-year
          endorsement deal with Nike, reportedly worth $2.5 million (plus
          royalties), an enormous outlay for an athlete who hadnt yet proven
          himself on the professional level. The NBA banned the original Air
          Jordan for not meeting the leagues stringent policy on uniforms and
          colors. Jordan wore them anyway and faced a $5,000-per-game fine as a
          result. Recognizing a unique marketing opportunity when it presented
          itself, Nike happily paid the fine. And MJ rocked them all the way to
          his Rookie of the Year honor. This Air Jordan was the only one in the
          series to feature the familiar Nike Swoosh logo. And predating the
          Jumpman logo, the OG shoe featured the Wings logo - a basketball with
          wings stretching from both sides and Air Jordan printed above the
          ball. Nike filed the Wings logo as a trademark on May 7, 1985. Leather
          overlays on the upper offered durability and easy color blocking, and
          a perforated leather toe box lent ventilation.
